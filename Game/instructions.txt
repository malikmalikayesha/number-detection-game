[1] Objective: Find the hidden number behind a grid of cells
    with three lives

[4] Hint System: After the first try, the game provides a 
    hint to the user to narrow down the search. The cells 
    that might have the target number behind them are subtly 
    highlighted with a different color, making it easier for 
    the player to make informed choices in the subsequent 
    attempts. Use this hint wisely to maximize your score.
